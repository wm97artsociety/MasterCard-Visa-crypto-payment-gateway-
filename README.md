Crypto Card Extension
A browser extension for direct crypto purchases using Visa and MasterCard — no third-party brokers.

The Crypto Card Extension is a lightweight, secure browser add-on that enables users to buy cryptocurrency directly with their Visa or MasterCard — without relying on intermediaries like MoonPay or custodial platforms. Powered by a custom backend API integrated with Cybersource (a Visa-owned payment processor), this extension gives users full control over fiat-to-crypto transactions.

Key Features:

🔐 Direct Visa/MasterCard payment integration

💸 Purchase crypto (BTC, ETH) through your browser

🛠 Own backend API — no third-party brokers

🌐 Easy setup for Chrome as an unpacked extension

⚙️ Node.js backend and React-based frontend

This tool is ideal for developers or startups looking to integrate card-based crypto payments into their workflows while maintaining full autonomy over the transaction pipeline.
